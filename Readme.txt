this project is based on the great work of Smint, which is maintained by Robert McCracken.
you can find SMint at:http://www.outyear.co.uk/smint/

There are some differences between lmint and smint:
1. you can use any element as your navigation item as long as they have 'navitem' in classes.
2. you have to tell lmint which target is for this navigation item by applying attribute 'lmint-target' on your item.
